# üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

## System Overview

The AI Habit Coach is a machine learning system designed to model and predict individual habit formation behavior. It uses a hybrid approach combining behavioral simulation and real-world data collection.

## Core Components

### 1. Profiler (`src/profiler.py`)

**Purpose**: Capture user behavioral patterns through structured questionnaire

**Data Collected**:
- Temporal patterns (wake/sleep times, peak energy periods)
- Psychological traits (personality type, motivation style, stress response)
- Historical data (past successes/failures, typical triggers)
- Environmental context (work schedule, social support)
- Day-specific difficulty ratings

**Output**: `UserProfile` object ‚Üí JSON file in `data/profiles/`

**Design Rationale**:
- Rich profiling enables accurate behavioral simulation
- Structured data allows feature engineering for ML models
- One-time setup with option to update

### 2. Behavioral Simulator (`src/simulator.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate synthetic training data based on user profile

**Algorithm**:
```python
for each_day in simulation_period:
    # Sample environmental factors
    sleep_quality = sample_from_distribution()
    stress_level = sample_based_on_day_of_week()
    
    # Calculate difficulty considering all factors
    difficulty = base_difficulty[day_of_week]
    difficulty += streak_effects
    difficulty += environmental_factors
    difficulty += individual_traits
    
    # Calculate motivation
    motivation = comfort_with_difficulty
    motivation += streak_bonus
    motivation -= gap_penalty
    
    # Predict completion
    completion_prob = sigmoid(motivation - difficulty)
    completed = random() < completion_prob
```

**Key Features**:
- Incorporates research-backed habit formation patterns:
  - Early days harder (learning curve)
  - Streaks create momentum
  - Gaps make restart harder
  - Environmental factors matter
  - Individual differences are crucial

- Realistic randomness:
  - Normal distributions for continuous variables
  - Day-specific patterns (weekends different from weekdays)
  - Occasional bad days (life happens)

**Output**: `SimulatedDay` DataFrame ‚Üí CSV in `data/synthetic/`

**Validation**: Typical synthetic datasets show 60-75% completion rate with streaks of 7-21 days, matching real habit formation research.

### 3. ML Training Pipeline (`src/train.py`)

**Purpose**: Train predictive models on synthetic + real data

**Models**:

#### Completion Predictor (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Task**: Predict P(completion | context)
- **Features** (19 total):
  - Temporal: day_of_week, hour, time_period flags
  - Progress: day_number, current_streak, days_since_last, total_completions
  - Psychological: difficulty, motivation
  - Environmental: sleep_quality, stress_level, work_intensity, social_obligations
  - Interactions: streak_momentum, gap_penalty, stress_workload

- **Architecture**:
  - 100 trees, max_depth=10
  - Class weights balanced (handles imbalanced data)
  - StandardScaler for feature normalization

- **Training Strategy**:
  - Real data weighted 3x more than synthetic
  - 80/20 train/test split
  - Stratified sampling (preserve completion rate distribution)

**Performance Metrics**:
- Accuracy: Typically 75-85% on synthetic, 85-95% with real data
- Feature importance reveals top predictors (varies by individual)
- Precision/recall for both classes

**Output**: Trained models ‚Üí joblib file in `models/`

### 4. Tracking Application (`src/app.py`)

**Purpose**: Daily habit tracking with AI-powered insights

**Features**:
- Log completions with difficulty/motivation ratings
- View stats (streaks, completion rate, patterns)
- AI recommendations (optimal times, predictions)
- Automatic model retraining

**Data Flow**:
```
User logs completion
    ‚Üì
Save to data/real/{name}_real.csv
    ‚Üì
Models predict optimal times for tomorrow
    ‚Üì
(Optional) Retrain models with new data
    ‚Üì
Show updated insights
```

**AI Recommendations**:
- Optimal time prediction: Tests all hours, ranks by success probability
- Current context prediction: "Right now, you have 73% chance"
- Pattern warnings: "You typically skip on Wednesdays after 6pm"
- Streak encouragement: Milestone celebrations

### 5. Visualization (`src/visualize.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate insights through data visualization

**Plots**:
1. **Timeline**: Daily completion history (green/red dots)
2. **Weekly Heatmap**: Completion rate by day of week
3. **Streak Analysis**: Progression and distribution
4. **Difficulty/Motivation Scatter**: Identify patterns
5. **Dashboard**: Comprehensive overview

**Output**: PNG files in `data/visualizations/`

## Data Models

### UserProfile (Pydantic)
```python
- Basic: name, habit_description, target_duration
- Schedule: wake_time, sleep_time, peak_energy_times
- Personality: motivation_style, stress_response, distraction_prone
- History: past_successes/failures, typical_failure_triggers
- Weekly: {day}_difficulty for each day
```

### HabitCompletion (Pydantic)
```python
- timestamp, completed (bool)
- difficulty_rating, motivation_rating (1-10)
- duration_minutes
- context: time_of_day, day_of_week, location
- intervention: reminder_sent, message_shown
```

### SimulatedDay (Pydantic)
```python
- day_number, day_of_week, time_attempted
- completed, difficulty, motivation
- environmental: sleep_quality, stress_level, social_obligations, work_intensity
- tracking: days_since_last, current_streak, total_completions
```

## Algorithm Choices

### Why Random Forest for Completion Prediction?
- **Pros**:
  - Handles non-linear relationships
  - Robust to outliers
  - Feature importance insights
  - No hyperparameter tuning needed initially
  - Works well with small datasets

- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Logistic Regression: Too simple for behavioral patterns
  - XGBoost: Overkill for dataset size, harder to interpret
  - Neural Network: Requires more data, black box

### Why StandardScaler?
- Normalizes features to similar scales
- Improves convergence for gradient-based methods
- Not strictly necessary for RF, but good practice

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning

**Contextual Bandit for Reminder Timing**:
```python
State: [hour, day, streak, stress, ...]
Actions: [remind_now, wait_1h, wait_2h, skip]
Reward: +1 if completed after action, 0 otherwise
Algorithm: Thompson Sampling or LinUCB
```

**Multi-Armed Bandit for Message Testing**:
```python
Arms: [encouraging, firm, data_focused, motivational, humorous]
Reward: message_opened + habit_completed
Algorithm: Œµ-greedy ‚Üí UCB1
```

**Q-Learning for Difficulty Adjustment**:
```python
State: [streak, avg_difficulty, recent_success_rate]
Actions: [increase_difficulty, maintain, decrease]
Reward: weighted(completion, challenge_level)
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

**LLM-Powered Coach**:
- Natural language check-ins
- Personalized advice generation
- Struggle analysis and strategy suggestions
- Prompt: "You are a habit coach for {name}. Their profile: {profile}. Recent patterns: {data}. Provide encouragement."

**Wearable Integration**:
- Real sleep data from Apple Health / Fitbit
- Heart rate variability ‚Üí stress estimation
- Activity levels ‚Üí energy estimation
- Calendar API ‚Üí work intensity inference

**Community Learning**:
- Federated learning across users
- "People like you succeeded with..."
- Transfer learning from similar profiles
- Privacy-preserving (differential privacy)

**Habit Graduation Detection**:
```python
Criteria:
- 90+ days tracked
- 90%+ completion rate in last 30 days
- Low difficulty ratings (habit is easy now)
- Self-reported: "feels automatic"

ML Model: Predicts if habit is truly installed
```

## Deployment Considerations

**Training**: ~5 seconds (100 trees on 90 samples)
**Inference**: <10ms per prediction
**Visualization**: ~2 seconds for all plots

**Data Size**:
- Profile: ~2KB JSON
- Synthetic data: ~50KB (90 days)
- Real data: ~1KB per day
- Trained model: ~500KB

## Code Quality

**Tools**:

- Reusable components (ProfilerLoader used by all)
- Consistent CLI interface (main.py entry point)

## Research Validation

**Habit Formation Science**:
- 21-day myth: Actually 66 days on average (Lally et al., 2010)
- Streak effects: Momentum is real but plateaus
- Missing days: 1 day slip doesn't break habit, but 3+ does
- Individual differences: 18-254 days range in research

**Our Simulator Incorporates**:
- Early difficulty (learning phase)
- Streak momentum (but diminishing returns)
- Gap penalty (exponential difficulty increase)
- Day-of-week patterns (weekends are different)
- Environmental factors (stress, sleep, social)

## Privacy & Ethics

**Data Ownership**:
- All data stored locally
- User controls their data
- No cloud sync (currently)

**Future Considerations**:
- Opt-in anonymous data sharing
- Differential privacy for community learning
- Clear consent for each data use

**Ethical AI**:
- Transparent predictions (feature importance)
- No dark patterns (not manipulative)
- User can override AI suggestions
- Focus on sustainable habits, not addiction
