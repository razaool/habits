## 💡 Tips

### 🏃 Quick Test Before Deep Dive
Run `python quick_start.py` first to verify everything works!

### 📚 Documentation Order
1. GET_STARTED.md (practical)
2. README.md (comprehensive)
3. TUTORIAL.md (educational)
4. ARCHITECTURE.md (technical)

### 🔧 When Stuck
1. Check GET_STARTED.md → Troubleshooting
2. Verify setup: `python -c "import torch; print('OK')"`
3. Re-run setup.sh
4. Check error messages carefully

### 🎓 To Learn RL
Focus on TUTORIAL.md - it explains:
