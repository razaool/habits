## 🚀 Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Option 1: Use setup script
./setup.sh

# Option 2: Manual setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test system with small model (50 episodes, ~2-5 min)
python quick_start.py

# Or use Makefile
make quick-start
```

### Full Training
```bash
# Train full model (500 episodes, ~10-30 min)
python src/train.py

# Or use Makefile
make train
```

### Analysis
```bash
# Generate visualizations
python src/visualize.py
# or: make visualize

# Run interactive demo
python src/demo.py
# or: make demo
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After training 500 episodes:

| Metric | Random | Fixed 6PM | **RL Agent** |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Completion Rate | ~40% | ~65% | **~78%** ⭐ |
| Avg Streak | 2.3 | 4.5 | **6.8** ⭐ |
| Reminders/Day | 2.1 | 1.0 | **1.2** |
| User Satisfaction | Low | Medium | **High** ⭐ |

The RL agent learns to:
- ✅ Personalize timing to individual users
- ✅ Adapt to weekday vs weekend patterns
- ✅ Preserve streaks intelligently
- ✅ Avoid spamming users
- ✅ Consider context (location, calendar, activity)

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### 1. RL Algorithm Choice
**Why DQN?**
- Well-suited for discrete action spaces
- Proven stable with experience replay
- Efficient for problem size (15-dim state, 5 actions)
- Fast training on CPU

**Alternatives Considered:**
- PPO: Better for continuous, but overkill here
- A2C: Good option, but DQN simpler
- Bandits: Too simple, doesn't consider state

### 2. Reward Engineering
Carefully designed reward function:
```python
completion_immediate: +15  # Strong positive signal
completion_soon: +12       # Still good
completion_later: +8       # Acceptable
ignored: -1                # Mild negative
dismissed: -3              # Stronger negative
streak_bonus: +3           # Encourage consistency
spam_penalty: -2           # Avoid fatigue
```

### 3. State Representation
15 carefully chosen features:
- **Temporal**: When decisions matter
- **Historical**: Past predicts future
- **Contextual**: Situation awareness
- **Normalized**: 0-1 scale for stability

### 4. Exploration Strategy
Epsilon-greedy with exponential decay:
```
ε₀ = 1.0   (start: 100% exploration)
ε_final = 0.05 (end: 5% exploration)
decay = 0.995 per episode
```

### 5. Stability Techniques
- Experience replay (breaks correlations)
- Target network (reduces oscillations)
- Gradient clipping (prevents explosions)
- Layer normalization (stable training)
- Huber loss (robust to outliers)
